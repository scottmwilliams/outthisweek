As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey. Packer starts to piece together clues that lead him to a most terrifying secret: his imminent assassination. -- (C) Official Site",

When he finds himself juggling a bizarre relationship with the sexually precocious 18-year-old daughter (Brie Larson) of a former classmate and the advances of his very forward neighbor (Lucy Liu), Morris realizes that even though his life is unraveling, it's also opening up in ways that are long overdue. -- (C) Official Site",

        "synopsis": "The family of American bloodsuckers from The Hamiltons flees to England, where another, more powerful vampire clan awaits in this sequel to The Butcher Brothers' shocking feature debut. In the wake of a massacre at a remote gas station, The Hamilton's monstrous secret gets out. Desperate, they set their sights on England, and change their name to The Thompsons. Meanwhile, with the youngest sibling Lenny suffering mortal wounds, Francis follows rumors of another family of vampires to a quaint pub in the English countryside. Though his intuition was correct, Francis failed to realize that his English counterparts are more powerful than he ever could have imagined. After taking Francis hostage in a test of his powers, however, they quickly free him, and offer sanctuary to the fugitive family. But their benevolent offer masks dark intentions, and as the rest of The Thompsons make their way to the secluded safe haven, the American predators finally learn how it feels to be the prey. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",

The first segment, titled \"Last Day\" finds acrimony taking precedent over amenity during a farewell party for an employee who's about to move on. A bride and the priest who's officiating her wedding get an unpleasant surprise after running away together in \"Wedding Night,\" and a woman on the CTA receives a spontaneous gift that transforms her outlook on the world (at least, momentarily) in \"Flowers\". Lastly, a family preparing for a big relocation finds the forces of the universe seemingly aligned against them in \"Move\". ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",

His eldest, Patricia (the luminous Astrid Berges-Frisbey), has returned home from Paris to help raise her sisters, and Pascale dreams of marrying her off to his loyal assistant Felipe (Kad Merad). But when she's impregnated by a wealthy young pilot (Nicolas Duvauchelle) who promptly abandons her for the frontlines, Pascale is left to contend with the consequences. -- (C) Kino Lorber",

Nevertheless, Gus-who can tell a pitch just by the crack of the bat-refuses to be benched for what may be the final innings of his career. He may not have a choice. The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgment, especially with the country's hottest batting phenom on deck for the draft. The one person who might be able to help is also the one person Gus would never ask: his daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), an associate at a high-powered Atlanta law firm whose drive and ambition has put her on the fast track to becoming partner. Against her better judgment, and over Gus's objections, Mickey joins him on his latest scouting trip to North Carolina, jeopardizing her own career to save his. -- (C) Warner Bros.",

For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), even though he's got a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter (Jessica Biel) to find the head of the underground resistance (Bill Nighy) and stop Cohaagen. -- (C) Sony",
